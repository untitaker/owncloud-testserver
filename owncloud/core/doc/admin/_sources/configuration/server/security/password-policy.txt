ownCloud Enterprise users have the option of enabling `the Password Policy app`_. 
This application enables administrators to define password requirements, including: *minimum characters*, *numbers*, *capital letters*, and more, for all kinds of password endpoints, such as for user passwords and public link sharing passwords. 
Moreover the admin can enforce expiration dates for public link shares.
