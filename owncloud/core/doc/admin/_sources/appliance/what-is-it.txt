What is the Appliance?
======================

If you don't know a lot about Linux, only have a small IT staff, or are your IT staff — even if that's only in your spare time — the ownCloud X Appliance will let you get started using ownCloud quickly and easily.

The Appliance:

- Provides a pre-packaged, easy to deploy ownCloud ready for you in most popular virtual machine formats, including ``VMware``, ``KVM``, ``Xen``, and ``Hyper-V``.
- Contains the ownCloud 10.0.1 virtual image, and all the additional software you need to get up and running on ownCloud in minutes: *ownCloud X Server and Enterprise Apps*, *Apache 2*, *PHP*, and *MySQL*.
- Scales up to 250 users.

.. note:: 
   Some configurations, such as SAML IDPs, or LDAP or AD instances, may still be needed in order to connect.
   Depending on the intensity and pattern of use, this can vary from 150 up to 400 users.
