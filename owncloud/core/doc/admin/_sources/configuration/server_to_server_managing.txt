Managing Server-to-Server Sharing Access
========================================

You can manage how server-to-server sharing functions for internal and external
users and groups from the Admin page. The settings on the Admin page provide a
level of security for whether or not local or remote ownCloud users or groups
can access server-to-server shares.

To manage server-to-server sharing access:

1. Access the ownCloud Admin page.

2. In the Application View, scroll to the Remote Shares section of the page.

3. Enable or disable the remote shares options as desired:

   * ``Allow other instances to mount public links shared from this server`` --
     This option enables (checked) or disables (unchecked) the ability for
     remote ownCloud users to access public links that you share from the
     server.

   * ``Allow users to mount public link shares`` -- This option enables
     (checked) or disables (unchecked) users on the local server to add shares
     (folders or files) to the current ownCloud instance.

For information about how to use server-to-server sharing, "Using Server-to-Server Sharing"
in the Users Manual.
